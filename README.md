Image Recolorizationn using CNNs, autoencoders, and Deep Learning

- In order for the model to run quickly, run using Google Colab so that you can utilize the GPU and so that you can perform transfer learning.
- All code was written by following this paper:

 @Article{IizukaSIGGRAPH2016,
   author = {Satoshi Iizuka and Edgar Simo-Serra and Hiroshi Ishikawa},
   title = {{Let there be Color!: Joint End-to-end Learning of Global and Local Image Priors for Automatic Image Colorization with Simultaneous Classification}},
   journal = "ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proc. of SIGGRAPH 2016)",
   year = 2016,
   volume = 35,
   number = 4,
 }


NOTE: These recolorization process doesn't fully work but it manages to ceate very close results
NOTE: The transfer learning portion does not work
